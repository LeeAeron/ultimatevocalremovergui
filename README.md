## About

This application uses state-of-the-art source separation models to remove vocals from audio files. UVR's core developers trained all of the models provided in this package (except for the Demucs v3 and v4 4-stem models).

## Installation

This fork will be provided with only *.bat installer/updater/starter file, that will download and install all components and build Portable UVR engine.

### Windows Installation

- Please Note:
    - I'm supporting only nVidia GTX10xx-16xx and RTX20xx-50xx GPUs.
    - This installer is intended for those running Windows 10 or higher. 
    - Application functionality for systems running Windows 7 or lower is not guaranteed.

- Download the UVR .bat installer for Windows in releases.
- Place .bat file in any directory in the Root of any partition. Launch it. Choose INSTALL (2), and .bat file will download and install locally latest UVR Portable engine.
- After install process finished, select START (1), UVR will launch.

### Other Application Notes
- Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB is the minimum requirement for GPU conversions.
- Nvidia GPUs with at least 6GBs of V-RAM are recommended.
- This application is only compatible with 64-bit platforms. 
- This application relies on the Rubber Band library for the Time-Stretch and Pitch-Shift options.
- This application relies on FFmpeg to process non-wav audio files.
- The application will automatically remember your settings when closed.
- Conversion times will significantly depend on your hardware. 
- These models are computationally intensive. 

### Performance:
- Model load times are faster.
- Importing/exporting audio files is faster.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- If FFmpeg is not installed, the application will throw an error if the user attempts to convert a non-WAV file.
- Memory allocation errors can usually be resolved by lowering the "Segment" or "Window" sizes.

### Issue Reporting

Please be as detailed as possible when posting a new issue. 

If possible, click the "Settings Button" to the left of the "Start Processing" button and click the "Error Log" button for detailed error information that can be provided to us.
